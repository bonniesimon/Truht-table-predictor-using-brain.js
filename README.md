# Truth-table-predictor-using-brain.js
A Machine Learning program to predict the output of the given truth table using brain.js.

Truth table  :

| Input 1 | Input 2 | Input 3 | Output |
|---------|---------|---------|--------|
| 0       | 0       | 0       | 0      |
| 0       | 0       | 1       | 0      |
| 0       | 1       | 0       | 0      |
| 0       | 1       | 1       | 1      |
| 1       | 0       | 0       | 0      |
| 1       | 0       | 1       | 1      |

i.e for odd number of 1 in input , output is 0. And for even number of 1 in input , ouput is 1.

### What I've learned from this :
- Installing brain.js using npm
- Creating a neural network and training it and also running it with test input
